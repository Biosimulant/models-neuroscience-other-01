# Space Prompt - neuroscience-basal-ganglia-dopamine-combo-0002

Create a scientifically coherent **neuroscience / basal_ganglia_dopamine** comparative space using:
- Base models: neuroscience-other-112359-112359-model, neuroscience-other-112968-112968-model
- Observability monitors:
  - observability-state-comparison-monitor
  - observability-state-metrics-monitor

Requirements:
1. No unsupported causal claims.
2. Route each base model state-like stream to monitor inputs `state_a..state_d`.
3. Explain why these models belong together.
4. Include clear interpretation guidance for visuals.
